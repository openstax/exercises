    <p>The OpenStax assessment format supports multi-part and single-part questions in multiple formats.  The
    data is stored in a JSON-encoded string</p>

    <p>The top level may contain a <b>stimulus_html</b> field.  This is where a common introduction
    for a multi-part question is stored.  Nothing prohibits this field from being used for a
    single-part question.</p>

    <p>The top level will contain a <b>questions</b> array.  This field will have one entry for a
    single-part question and multiple entries for a multi-part question. Each question contains
    the following fields:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>stimulus_html</b>: html that introduces this question; may be blank/missing.</li>
      <li><b>stem_html</b>: html that contains the actual question or directive.</li>
      <li><b>answers</b>: present if the assessment is multiple choice; contains:
        <ol>
          <li><b>content_html</b>: html with the answer content</li>
          <li><b>correctness</b>: a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.  1.0 is fully correct.</li>
          <li><b>feedback_html</b>: html containing feedback in the event this answer is chosen.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>formats</b>: an array of formats; most questions are 'multiple-choice' that can also be asked as 'free-response'.</li>
      <li><b>collaborator_solutions</b>: an array of worked solutions for the assessment; contains:
        <ol>
          <li><b>content_html</b>: </li>
          <li><b>solution_type</b>: one of 'summary', 'detailed', or 'example'</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>tags</b>: an array of string tags</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are other fields in the content that are largely self-explanatory or not necessary for using
    the assessment.</p>

    <p>OpenStax does have a different multi-stem format which should not be used in any
    a15k contributions, but if you find one please contact OpenStax for details.</p>
