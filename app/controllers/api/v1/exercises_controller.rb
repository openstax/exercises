    # Using route helpers doesn't work in test or production, probably has to do with initialization order

    param :q, String, desc: <<-EOS
      The search query string, built up as a space-separated collection of
      search conditions on different fields. Each condition is formatted as
      "field_name:comma-separated-values". The resulting list of exercises will
      match all of the conditions (boolean 'and'). Each condition will produce
      a list of exercises where those exercises must match any of the
      comma-separated-values (boolean 'or'). The fields_names and their
      characteristics are given below.
      When a field is listed as using wildcard matching, it means that any
      fields that start with a comma-separated-value will be matched.

      * `content` &ndash; Matches the exercise content. (uses wildcard matching)
      * `solution` &ndash; Matches the exercise solution content.
                           (uses wildcard matching)
      * `author` &ndash; Matches authors' and copyright holders' first, last, or full names.
                         (uses wildcard matching)
      * `number` &ndash; Matches the exercise number exactly.
      * `version` &ndash; Matches the exercise version exactly.
      * `id` &ndash; Matches the exercise ID or UID exactly.

      You can also add search terms without prefixes, separated by spaces.
      These terms will be searched for in all of the prefix categories.
      Any matching exercises will be returned. When combined with prefixed search
      terms, the final results will contain exercises matching any of the non
      prefixed terms and all of the prefixed terms.

      Examples:

      `content:DTFT` &ndash; returns exercises containing the DTFT word.

      `number:1 version:2` &ndash; returns exercise 1@2.
    EOS
    param :order_by, String, desc: <<-EOS
      A string that indicates how to sort the results of the query.
      The string is a comma-separated list of fields with an optional sort direction.
      The sort will be performed in the order the fields are given.
      The fields can be one of #{
        SearchExercises::SORTABLE_FIELDS.keys.map { |sf| "`"+sf+"`" }.join(', ')
      }.
      Sort directions can either be `ASC` for an ascending sort, or `DESC` for a descending sort.
      If not provided, an ascending sort is assumed.
      Sort directions should be separated from the fields by a space. (default: `number ASC`)

      Example:

      `number, version DESC` &ndash; sorts by number ascending, then by version descending
